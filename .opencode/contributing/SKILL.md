# Contributing to opencode-swarm

## 1. Branch Setup

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Branch naming: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g. `feat/add-retry-backoff`, `fix/plan-sync-race`).

## 2. Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)

Every commit MUST follow: `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`

Rules:
- Description lowercase, no trailing period
- Scope optional but encouraged

| Type | Changelog section | Version bump |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `feat` | Features | minor |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes | patch |
| `perf` | Performance | patch |
| `revert` | Reverts | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation | none |
| `chore` | — | none |
| `refactor` | — | none |
| `test` | — | none |
| `ci` | — | none |
| `build` | — | none |

Breaking changes: add `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` footer or `!` suffix on type (e.g. `feat!:`). Triggers major bump.

Valid examples:
- `feat(architect): add retry backoff to SME delegation`
- `fix(circuit-breaker): prevent race condition on concurrent invocations`
- `refactor(swarm): extract phase orchestration into dedicated module`

Invalid (rejected by CI):
- `WIP`, `fix stuff`, `Update README`, `feat: Add feature.` (trailing period), `Feat:` (uppercase)

## 3. Release Notes (MANDATORY — every PR, no exceptions)

1. Read current version: `cat .release-please-manifest.json`
2. Compute next version based on commit types (feat = minor, fix/perf = patch)
3. Create file: `docs/releases/v{NEXT_VERSION}.md`

Include:
- What changed (grouped by theme)
- Why (bug report, feature request, hardening)
- Migration steps (if any)
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Known caveats

Even one-line changes need release notes explaining why it matters.

## 4. Run All Checks Locally (5 tiers, all must pass)

```bash
# Tier 1: Quality
bun run typecheck
bunx biome ci .

# Tier 2: Unit tests
bun test tests/unit --timeout 120000

# Tier 3: Integration tests
bun test tests/integration ./test --timeout 120000

# Tier 4: Security & adversarial
bun test tests/security --timeout 120000
bun test tests/adversarial --timeout 120000

# Tier 5: Build + smoke
bun run build
bun test tests/smoke --timeout 120000
```

If a pre-existing unrelated failure exists, note it in the PR description but do NOT skip other tiers.

## 5. Push and Open PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

PR title MUST be a valid conventional commit: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

PR body template:
```
## Summary
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

## Test plan
- [ ] Tier 1 quality checks pass
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security/adversarial tests pass
- [ ] Build + smoke tests pass
```

## 6. Do NOT Manually Edit These Files

release-please manages these automatically:
- `package.json` version field
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.release-please-manifest.json`

Never replace the release PR body, create tags/releases manually, or edit these files.

## 7. CI Checks (all must be green)

| Check | Validates |
|-------|-----------|
| `quality` | TypeScript compiles, Biome lint + format clean |
| `unit` (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) | Unit tests pass cross-platform |
| `integration` (Ubuntu) | Integration tests pass |
| `security` (Ubuntu) | Security & adversarial tests pass |
| `smoke` (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) | Package builds & smoke tests pass |
| `pr-standards` | PR title is valid conventional commit |
| `check-duplicates` | PR title not duplicate of open PR |

## 8. GitHub Actions SHA Pinning

All `uses:` in `.github/workflows/` must be pinned to full 40-char SHA with version comment:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
```

Find SHA: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag} --jq '.object.sha'`
